# The Running man
A Unity Game Project, the Running man tries to avoid obtacles.

Here you can see a simple 3D unity game "the running man".
At first glance, there is the game's menu. After starting the game, the running man appears and is moving towards some obstacles. The job of the player is to jump or change directions(go left and right) to avoid hitting the obstacles!

## This was the bonus project of the Advanced Programming course.
